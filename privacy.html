<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Last updated: 2025-12-07</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Makoto Ogami / N8N Auto TikTok Poster</strong> ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when using our web services and integrations with TikTok's APIs.</p>

<h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Account / Business Account identifiers:</strong> TikTok account identifiers required to publish content (only when you authorize the app).</li>
  <li><strong>Content data:</strong> Video files and metadata (title, caption, hashtags) that you or the automation pipeline uploads for publishing.</li>
  <li><strong>No personal data collection:</strong> We do not collect or store end-user personal data beyond what TikTok requires for publishing to the connected Business Account. We do not collect credentials (user passwords) — OAuth tokens are used per TikTok’s API.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Data</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To upload and publish videos to the connected TikTok Business Account via TikTok Content Posting API.</li>
  <li>To log events and errors for debugging and support (minimal logs: timestamps, API call response codes).</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain uploaded video files and logs for up to 30 days after publishing for troubleshooting. Access tokens are retained only as required to maintain the integration and are deleted if the integration is revoked.</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We use third-party services (TikTok) to publish content. We do not share user data with other third parties except as required to provide the service (for example cloud storage or AI video generator if used). Any third-party service is selected for security and reliability.</p>

<h2>5. Security</h2>
<p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data (encrypted storage for secrets, least privilege access, HTTPS). However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

<h2>6. Children</h2>
<p>Our service is not intended for children under 13.</p>

<h2>7. Contact</h2>
<p>If you have questions, contact: <a href="mailto:peerapat.skt@gmail.com">peerapat.skt@gmail.com</a></p>

<h2>8. Changes</h2>
<p>We may update this policy; we will publish the date of last update here.</p>
